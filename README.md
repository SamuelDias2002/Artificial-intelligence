# Artificial intelligence

 Artificial intelligence - Computer Science and engineering at UBI

 This repository has:
    - All practical things done during AI classes.
    - Final project (Later) 

Warnings:
    - All programs are made in Python, and only contain comments about things I didn't know about. Later I might decide to comment on everything.
    - This is also my first time programming in Python (I already knew some basic things, but never practiced before), so if you see something "wrong", it's because I don't know how to do it. I've probably already asked for help and figured out what to do, I just haven't had time to update the code and repository yet.
    - At this time (21/09/2023 or 09/21/2023 if you like the american style xD) this repository is a "work in progress", more things will be added in the coming weeks (as I take AI classes)
